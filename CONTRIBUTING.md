### Who Can Contribute?

The world of open source allows for everyone to contribute towards the development of the [Prolike](https://www.prolike.io/) website. 

#### The Prolike Team

Thus far, only the core team of Prolike have been contributing towards the website - not all too suprisingly. We consider it our own, and have from day one been looking to enhance the ever-evolving project at much as possible, and we don't plan to be stopping any time soon.

#### Open Sourcerers

As mentioned above, everyone's able to contribute towards the website, as the repository itself is public and open to all open sourceres. Should you wish to contribute from the outside, there is a few considerations to be made in advance.

### How Can You Contribute?

We're already super hyped that you're here, reading this, allthough we have to be completely honest with you.

#### Our Workflow

As a company, of course we've already got our own workflow [our own workflow](https://www.prolike.io/anything/learn-how-we-work/) setup for the way we go about developing our website. This means, we aren't considering work from the outside, unless it's presented to us as a pull request.

#### Pull Requests

For now, this is the best and preferred way to contribute towards our website. More information will come eventually, when we get around to describing how we'd prefer potential pull requests to work. For now, you can take a look at the [official documentation]([https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)) for using and opening a pull request here on Github.

#### Bug Fixes

Have you found something that doesn't seem quite right? Please follow the steps below in order to help bring our attention to any eventual bugs or errors that we need to have another look at.

- **Open a Github Issue**: Within the Prolike repository, [open an issue](https://github.com/prolike/prolike.io/issues/new) related to the bug you've discovered.

- **Be Descriptive and Consise**:  When submitting an issue, make use of a descriptive title, consise and to-the-point language, that leaves no room for confusion. Remember to attach the **Bug** label to the issue you've opened.

- **Reporting an error**:  If the issue you're raising is frontend level and visual in its nature, please insert screen dumps, that can help to give us a visual understanding of what you're describing.

- **Reporting a bug**:  Along with the guidelines above, please make use of a step-by-step description of how you encountered the bug, and if possible, explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
